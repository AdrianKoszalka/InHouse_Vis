# InHouse_Vis

InHouse is an application designed to visualize workspaces, especially in the manufacturing industry. In a clear way, the application provides for managers information on employee absence, unused workstations and workspace load. InHouse is connected to a database that stores data from the employee card reader. A built-in auto refresh function provides updated data every 10 seconds.
